    "temperature (850 ºC < T < 1200 ºC)\n",
    "using either water vapor (“wet\n",
    "oxidation”) or oxygen (“dry oxidation”). They are both Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) techniques as the deposition happends thanks to a chemical reaction at the surface of the substrat. They are thin film deposition techniques but are in a separate notebook as they are specific processes but widely used in industry for most of the processes. The high temperature speeds up the chemical reaction. At room temperature the oxidation wouldn't be possible (or limited to a few nanometers).__\n",

    "Oxidation of silicon is crucial as the oxide of silicon SiO2 is an extremely important material in semi-conductor technology. It is used for various purposes such as gate dielectric in MOS (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) transistors, insulator layers in integrated circuits, and protective layers against contamination and damage. The highly insulating nature of SiO2 allows it to be an effective barrier between different layers in the device, preventing current leakage and ensuring high performance. Additionally, SiO2 also possesses excellent thermal stability and good chemical resistance, making it an ideal choice for use in harsh environments. Moreover, it plays a fundamental role in photolithography processes, which are vital for pattern definition in semiconductor device fabrication. Oxidation of silicon thus has a direct impact on the performance and reliability of a wide range of electronic devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both techniques are performed by introducting the wafers inside furnaces which can heat up at high temperatures while injecting gazes in a vaccum.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Wet oxidation__ is obtained done by adding $H_2O$ vapor inside the furnace. The $SiO_2$ is obtained by the following reaction: $ Si (s) + H_2O (l) = SiO_2 + 2H_2 (g) $\n",
    "* __Dry oxidation__ is obtained done by adding $O_2$ vapor inside the furnace. The $SiO_2$ is obtained by the following reaction: $Si (s) + O_2 (g) = SiO_2 (s)$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The thickness of the layer first grows linearly (thickness ~ time) but then follows a square root law (thickness ~ $\\sqrt time$ as the oxygene or water molecules need to diffuse through the $SiO_2$ to oxidize the $Si$. As you will see later the type of oxidation greatly depends on the type of $SiO_2$ layer you need.\n",

They are hold by a special holder which resist the extrem heat of the machine. These furnaces can perform both types of oxidation. However in practice each chamber of the furnace is reserved for a single type of oxidation for purity and conveniancy conserns. Moreover this step tends to always happend in the first steps of the process as it requires to have access to the silicon of the wafer (which isn't possible if it is covered by layers of materials). The heat of the process also makes it almost incompatible with any other previous step as could damage some layers or create great stress in the structure."

    "- The lighter part the oxdie that ends up above the original surface location. \n",
    "In reality there is no boundary between these two regions. The objective in using two colors is only to illustrate that the new oxide layer does not grow on top of the silicon. On the contrary, the growth of the oxide is achieved at the expense of consuming some of the Si (the one that was occupying the dark volume). The volume of the $SiO_2$ originated by the chemical reaction is greater than the one of the silicon consumed, so the $SiO_2$ layer occupies the dar and light volumes now. \n",

    "During the process the oxygen atoms are able to diffuse through the already-formed $SiO_2$ layer, reach the Si-SiO2 interface (between black and dark regions), and react with more silicon atoms to form $SiO_2$. Here part of the $Si$ atoms is consumed. As new $SiO_2$ molecules are formed at the Si-SiO2 interface, the molecular volume increase pushes the existing $SiO_2$ layer further \"upwards\" into the oxidizing environment. That is why part of the layer is below the original interface and part of it above. \n",
